# Simulations
```main.py``` is the script that runs the simulations. This script will attempt to interactively connect to OpticStudio (ANSYS) using [ZOSPy](https://github.com/MREYE-LUMC/ZOSPy). To toggle between monochromatic and polychromatic simulations uncomment (and comment) the corresponding line in 708 and 709. The corresponding ```zar``` file should also be opened in OpticStudio prior to executing the script. The polychromatic simulation takes several hours to complete.
# Environment
PIXI was used to manage the packages required for the simulation.
